# Publish to PyPI using Trusted Publishers (OIDC) when a GitHub release is created.
# No API tokens or secrets needed — PyPI trusts this repository directly.
#
# Prerequisites (one-time setup on PyPI):
#   1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/project/toqito/settings/publishing/
#   2. Add a new "GitHub Actions" trusted publisher with:
#        - Owner: vprusso
#        - Repository: toqito
#        - Workflow name: publish-release.yml
#        - Environment: pypi
#   3. That's it — no tokens to rotate or store.
