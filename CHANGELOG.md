  to obtain the measurement operators and also to use the computationally
  efficiency of the dual problem to make quicker numeric calculations.

  of this hierarchy can become intractable quite quickly.

  discrimination in `state_distinguishability.py`. Adding additional tests to
  `test_state_distinguishability.py` to cover this extra feature.
