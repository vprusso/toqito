        "## The extended nonlocal game model\nAn *extended nonlocal game* is similar to a nonlocal game in the sense that it\nis a cooperative game played between two players Alice and Bob against a\nreferee. The game begins much like a nonlocal game, with the referee selecting\nand sending a pair of questions $(x,y)$ according to a fixed probability\ndistribution. Once Alice and Bob receive $x$ and $y$, they respond\nwith respective answers $a$ and $b$. Unlike a nonlocal game, the\noutcome of an extended nonlocal game is determined by measurements performed by\nthe referee on its share of the state initially provided to it by Alice and\nBob.\n\n![extended nonlocal game](../../../figures/extended_nonlocal_game.svg){.center}\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An extended nonlocal game. </em></p>\n\nSpecifically, Alice and Bob's winning probability is determined by\ncollections of measurements, $V(a,b|x,y) \\in \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{R})$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{C}^m$ is a complex Euclidean space with\n$m$ denoting the dimension of the referee's quantum system--so if Alice\nand Bob's response $(a,b)$ to the question pair $(x,y)$ leaves the\nreferee's system in the quantum state\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,b}^{x,y} \\in \\text{D}(\\mathcal{R}),\n$$\n\nthen their winning and losing probabilities are given by\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle V(a,b|x,y), \\sigma_{a,b}^{x,y} \\right\\rangle\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\left\\langle \\mathbb{I} - V(a,b|x,y), \\sigma_{a,b}^{x,y} \\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\n\n## Strategies for extended nonlocal games\n\nAn extended nonlocal game $G$ is defined by a pair $(\\pi, V)$,\nwhere $\\pi$ is a probability distribution of the form\n\n$$\n\\pi : \\Sigma_A \\times \\Sigma_B \\rightarrow [0, 1]\n$$\n\non the Cartesian product of two alphabets $\\Sigma_A$ and\n$\\Sigma_B$, and $V$ is a function of the form\n\n$$\nV : \\Gamma_A \\times \\Gamma_B \\times \\Sigma_A \\times \\Sigma_B \\rightarrow \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{R})\n$$\n\nfor $\\Sigma_A$ and $\\Sigma_B$ as above, $\\Gamma_A$ and\n$\\Gamma_B$ being alphabets, and $\\mathcal{R}$ refers to the\nreferee's space. Just as in the case for nonlocal games, we shall use the\nconvention that\n\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\Sigma_A \\times \\Sigma_B \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Gamma = \\Gamma_A \\times \\Gamma_B\n$$\n\nto denote the respective sets of questions asked to Alice and Bob and the sets\nof answers sent from Alice and Bob to the referee.\n\nWhen analyzing a strategy for Alice and Bob, it may be convenient to define a\nfunction\n\n$$\nK : \\Gamma_A \\times \\Gamma_B \\times \\Sigma_A \\times \\Sigma_B \\rightarrow \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{R}).\n$$\n\nWe can represent Alice and Bob's winning probability for an extended nonlocal\ngame as\n\n$$\n\\sum_{(x,y) \\in \\Sigma} \\pi(x,y) \\sum_{(a,b) \\in \\Gamma} \\left\\langle V(a,b|x,y), K(a,b|x,y) \\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\n### Standard quantum strategies for extended nonlocal games\n\nA *standard quantum strategy* for an extended nonlocal game consists of\nfinite-dimensional complex Euclidean spaces $\\mathcal{U}$ for Alice and\n$\\mathcal{V}$ for Bob, a quantum state $\\sigma \\in\n\\text{D}(\\mathcal{U} \\otimes \\mathcal{R} \\otimes \\mathcal{V})$, and two\ncollections of measurements\n\n$$\n\\{ A_a^x : a \\in \\Gamma_A \\} \\subset \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{U})\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\{ B_b^y : b \\in \\Gamma_B \\} \\subset \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{V}),\n$$\n\nfor each $x \\in \\Sigma_A$ and $y \\in \\Sigma_B$ respectively. As\nusual, the measurement operators satisfy the constraint that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_A} A_a^x = \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{U}}\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\sum_{b \\in \\Gamma_B} B_b^y = \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{V}},\n$$\n\nfor each $x \\in \\Sigma_A$ and $y \\in \\Sigma_B$.\n\nWhen the game is played, Alice and Bob present the referee with a quantum\nsystem so that the three parties share the state $\\sigma \\in\n\\text{D}(\\mathcal{U} \\otimes \\mathcal{R} \\otimes \\mathcal{V})$. The referee\nselects questions $(x,y) \\in \\Sigma$ according to the distribution\n$\\pi$ that is known to all participants in the game.\n\nThe referee then sends $x$ to Alice and $y$ to Bob. At this point,\nAlice and Bob make measurements on their respective portions of the state\n$\\sigma$ using their measurement operators to yield an outcome to send\nback to the referee. Specifically, Alice measures her portion of the state\n$\\sigma$ with respect to her set of measurement operators $\\{A_a^x\n: a \\in \\Gamma_A\\}$, and sends the result $a \\in \\Gamma_A$ of this\nmeasurement to the referee. Likewise, Bob measures his portion of the state\n$\\sigma$ with respect to his measurement operators\n$\\{B_b^y : b \\in \\Gamma_B\\}$ to yield the outcome $b \\in \\Gamma_B$,\nthat is then sent back to the referee.\n\nAt the end of the protocol, the referee measures its quantum system with\nrespect to the measurement $\\{V(a,b|x,y), \\mathbb{I}-V(a,b|x,y)\\}$.\n\nThe winning probability for such a strategy in this game $G = (\\pi,V)$ is\ngiven by\n\n$$\n\\sum_{(x,y) \\in \\Sigma} \\pi(x,y) \\sum_{(a,b) \\in \\Gamma}\n\\left \\langle A_a^x \\otimes V(a,b|x,y) \\otimes B_b^y,\n\\sigma\n\\right \\rangle.\n$$\n\nFor a given extended nonlocal game $G = (\\pi,V)$, we write\n$\\omega^*(G)$ to denote the *standard quantum value* of $G$, which\nis the supremum value of Alice and Bob's winning probability over all standard\nquantum strategies for $G$.\n\n### Unentangled strategies for extended nonlocal games\n\nAn *unentangled strategy* for an extended nonlocal game is simply a standard\nquantum strategy for which the state $\\sigma \\in \\text{D}(\\mathcal{U}\n\\otimes \\mathcal{R} \\otimes \\mathcal{V})$ initially prepared by Alice and Bob\nis fully separable.\n\nAny unentangled strategy is equivalent to a strategy where Alice and Bob store\nonly classical information after the referee's quantum system has been provided\nto it.\n\nFor a given extended nonlocal game $G = (\\pi, V)$ we write\n$\\omega(G)$ to denote the *unentangled value* of $G$, which is the\nsupremum value for Alice and Bob's winning probability in $G$ over all\nunentangled strategies. The unentangled value of any extended nonlocal game,\n$G$, may be written as\n\n$$\n\\omega(G) = \\max_{f, g}\n\\lVert\n\\sum_{(x,y) \\in \\Sigma} \\pi(x,y)\nV(f(x), g(y)|x, y)\n\\rVert\n$$\n\nwhere the maximum is over all functions $f : \\Sigma_A \\rightarrow\n\\Gamma_A$ and $g : \\Sigma_B \\rightarrow \\Gamma_B$.\n\n### Non-signaling strategies for extended nonlocal games\n\nA *non-signaling strategy* for an extended nonlocal game consists of a function\n\n$$\nK : \\Gamma_A \\times \\Gamma_B \\times \\Sigma_A \\times \\Sigma_B \\rightarrow \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{R})\n$$\n\nsuch that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_A} K(a,b|x,y) = \\rho_b^y \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{b \\in \\Gamma_B} K(a,b|x,y) = \\sigma_a^x,\n$$\n\nfor all $x \\in \\Sigma_A$ and $y \\in \\Sigma_B$ where\n$\\{\\rho_b^y : y \\in \\Sigma_B, b \\in \\Gamma_B\\}$ and $\\{\\sigma_a^x:\nx \\in \\Sigma_A, a \\in \\Gamma_A\\}$ are collections of operators satisfying\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_A} \\sigma_a^x = \\tau = \\sum_{b \\in \\Gamma_B} \\rho_b^y,\n$$\n\nfor every choice of $x \\in \\Sigma_A$ and $y \\in \\Sigma_B$ and where\n$\\tau \\in \\text{D}(\\mathcal{R})$ is a density operator.\n\nFor any extended nonlocal game, $G = (\\pi, V)$, the winning probability\nfor a non-signaling strategy is given by\n\n$$\n\\sum_{(x,y) \\in \\Sigma} \\pi(x,y) \\sum_{(a,b) \\in \\Gamma} \\left\\langle V(a,b|x,y) K(a,b|x,y) \\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nWe denote the *non-signaling value* of $G$ as $\\omega_{ns}(G)$\nwhich is the supremum value of the winning probability of $G$ taken over\nall non-signaling strategies for Alice and Bob.\n\n### Relationships between different strategies and values\n\nFor an extended nonlocal game, $G$, the values have the following relationship:\n\n\n!!! note\n\n    $$\n    0 \\leq \\omega(G) \\leq \\omega^*(G) \\leq \\omega_{ns}(G) \\leq 1.\n    $$\n\nNow that we have established the theoretical framework for extended nonlocal\ngames, we can explore some concrete examples. In the following tutorials, we\nwill construct well-known games such as the BB84 and CHSH extended nonlocal\ngames and use `|toqito\u27e9` to calculate their various values.\n\n%%\n\n"
