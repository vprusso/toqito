        "# Modeling Bit Commitment Binding Failure\n\nIn this tutorial, we will model a quantum bit commitment protocol as an\nextended nonlocal game where the \"player\" Alice attempts to cheat. Instead of\ncalculating a cooperative winning probability, we will quantify Alice's maximum\ncheating probability. This allows us to provide a concrete illustration of the failure of the\n*binding* property, a key aspect of the famous Mayers-Lo-Chau (MLC) no-go\ntheorem [@Mayers_1997_Unconditionally][@Lo_1997_Why].\n"

        "A bit commitment (BC) protocol is a cryptographic task involving two parties,\nAlice (the sender) and Bob (the receiver), which proceeds in two phases:\n\n1.  **Commit Phase:** Alice chooses a secret bit $b$ and provides Bob with\n    a piece of evidence (in this case, a quantum state).\n2.  **Reveal Phase:** At a later time, Alice announces the value of her bit, say\n    $b'$, and provides information that allows Bob to use his evidence\n    from the commit phase to verify her claim.\n\nFor the protocol to be secure, it must satisfy two fundamental properties:\n\n- **Hiding:** The evidence Bob receives during the **Commit Phase** must reveal\n  essentially no information about the value of Alice's bit $b$. Bob\n  should not be able to distinguish the evidence for $b=0$ from the\n  evidence for $b=1$.\n- **Binding:** Alice must be \"locked in\" to her choice after the **Commit Phase**.\n  She should not be able to change her mind and successfully convince Bob of a\n  different bit during the **Reveal Phase**. If she committed to $b=0$,\n  she cannot successfully open the commitment as $b=1$.\n\nThe Mayers-Lo-Chau (MLC) no-go theorem [@Mayers_1997_Unconditionally][@Lo_1997_Why]\nproves that no quantum protocol can be both perfectly hiding and binding. Here,\nwe will use the [`ExtendedNonlocalGame`][toqito.nonlocal_games.extended_nonlocal_game.ExtendedNonlocalGame] framework not to prove the full\ntheorem in its generality, but to illustrate the failure of\nthe binding property. We will model a simplified, single-shot protocol to make\nthe abstract threat of cheating concrete and quantifiable.\n\nThe core of this impossibility proof lies in Alice's ability to use an\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type of attack [@Mayers_1997_Unconditionally][@Lo_1997_Why]: she prepares an entangled state\nand shares one part with Bob, keeping the other. This entanglement allows her\nto delay her decision and \"steer\" the outcome to her advantage later on.\n\nThe failure of binding property occurs when the protocol is *hiding* but not *binding*,\nallowing Alice to \"change her mind.\" We can frame this as a game where Alice wins if she can\nsuccessfully respond to a challenge from the referee (playing the role of Bob).\n\n## Setting Up the Bit Commitment Game\n\n*   **Players:** The game models the two-party protocol between Alice (the\n    committer) and Bob (the receiver). To fit this cryptographic scenario into\n    our framework, we model the verifier, Bob, as the **Referee** who issues\n    the challenge. The 'player Bob' defined in the code is therefore a\n    simple stand-in with trivial inputs and outputs, as his active role\n    is handled by the Referee.\n\n*   **The Challenge (Referee's Input):** The Referee (Bob) will challenge Alice\n    to reveal her commitment to either bit $0$ or bit $1$. This is the Referee's\n    input, $y$, which can be $0$ or $1$. We assume he chooses between them with\n    equal probability, so $\\pi(y=0) = \\pi(y=1) = 0.5$.\n\n*   **Alice's Strategy (The Quantum State):** In this game, Alice's entire\n    strategy is encapsulated in the initial quantum state she prepares and\n    shares with the Referee. Because she doesn't receive a question or return\n    an answer in the traditional sense, her inputs $x$ and outputs $a$ are trivial.\n\n*   **The Winning Condition (Referee's Measurement):** Alice wins if the state she\n    gives the Referee passes his verification test.\n\n    - If challenged with $y=0$, the Referee measures with the projector for bit\n      $0$, $V(y=0) = |0\\rangle\\langle 0|$.\n    - If challenged with $y=1$, the Referee measures with the projector for bit\n      $1$, $V(y=1) = |+\\rangle\\langle +|$.\n\nThis choice of measurement bases is illustrative and inspired by states used in\nquantum key distribution. The power of the no-go theorem is that the protocol\nwould remain insecure regardless of the specific orthogonal states Bob uses for\nhis verification.\n\nNow, let's translate this game into code.\n\n\n"

        "## Interpreting the Result\n\nThe value returned by the solver, $\\approx 0.85355$, is not arbitrary. It represents\nthe maximum possible success probability for Alice and can be derived from\nfundamental quantum mechanics.\n\nAlice's average winning probability is the expectation value of an operator\nrepresenting the average of the two possible measurements:\n\n$$\nP(\\text{win}) = \\mathbb{E}[V] = 0.5 \\cdot \\text{Tr}(V(y=0) \\rho) + 0.5 \\cdot \\text{Tr}(V(y=1) \\rho) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\left[0.5 \\cdot (proj_0 + proj_p)\\right] \\rho \\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the state of the Referee's qubit. A key principle of\nquantum mechanics states that the maximum expectation value of an operator\nis its largest eigenvalue. The operator here is $M = 0.5 \\cdot (proj_0 + proj_p)$.\n\nThe largest eigenvalue of this operator $M$ is:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(M) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\approx 0.85355.\n$$\n\nWe found this exact value using `|toqito\u27e9`. In a secure protocol, the best\nAlice could hope for is a $50$%  success rate (by guessing the challenge). The\nfact that she can achieve over $85$% demonstrates a catastrophic failure of the\n*binding* property, confirming the no-go theorem.\n\nIt is important to note that this value of $\\approx 0.85355$ represents the maximum cheating\nprobability for *this specific, imperfectly hiding game*. The full MLC no-go theorem\nmakes an even stronger claim: for any protocol that is *perfectly hiding* (where Bob\ncannot gain any information at all about the bit before the reveal phase), Alice's\ncheating strategy can succeed with $100$% probability. This example demonstrates the\nfragility of the binding property, which worsens to a total failure in the\nperfectly hiding limit.\n\n\n"
