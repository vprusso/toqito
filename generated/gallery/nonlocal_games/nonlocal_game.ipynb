        "A primary challenge that arises when studying these games is to determine the\nmaximum probability with which Alice and Bob are able to achieve a winning\noutcome.\n\nThis probability is highly dependent on the type of *strategy* that Alice and\nBob use in the game. A *classical strategy* is one in which Alice and Bob have\naccess to classical resources. The best that Alice and Bob can do using a\nclassical strategy is known as the *classical value* of the game. Similarly, a\n*quantum strategy* is one in which Alice and Bob have access to quantum\nresources. The best that Alice and Bob can do using a quantum strategy is known\nas the *quantum value* of the game.\n\nCalculating the classical value of a game is NP-hard as we need to perform a\nbrute-force check to see which strategy yields the classical value of the game.\n\nUsing `|toqito\u27e9`, we will be able to specify a nonlocal game and be able to\ndirectly calculate the classical value and also place lower bounds on the\nquantum value.\n\nFurther information beyond the scope of this tutorial on nonlocal games can be\nfound in [@cleve2010consequences]. Further information on the lower bound technique can be found in\n[@liang2007bounds].\n\n## Two-player nonlocal games\n\nA *two-player nonlocal game* consists of players that we give the names *Alice*\nand *Bob*:\n\n![nonlocal game](../../../figures/alice_and_bob.svg){.center}\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The players: Alice and Bob.</em></p>\n\nAlice and Bob are in separate locations and cannot communicate once the game\nbegins. Prior to the game however, Alice and Bob are free to communicate with\neach other. In addition to the players, there is also another party in this\ngame that is referred to as the *referee*.\n\n![nonlocal game](../../../figures/referee.svg){.center}\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The referee.</em></p>\n\nAlice and Bob want to play in a cooperative fashion against the referee.\n\nNow that we have set the stage with respect to the actors and actresses we will\nencounter in this game, let us see how the game is actually played.\n\n![nonlocal game](../../../figures/nonlocal_game.svg){.center}\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A two-player nonlocal game.</em></p>\n\nA nonlocal game unfolds in the following manner.\n\n1. The referee randomly generates questions denoted as $x$ and $y$.\n   The referee sends the question $x$ to Alice and the question\n   $y$ to Bob. The referee also keeps a copy of $x$ and\n   $y$ for reference.\n\n2. Alice and Bob each receive their respective questions. They are then each\n   expected to respond to their questions with answers that we denote as\n   $a$ and $b$. Alice sends $a$ to the referee, and Bob\n   sends $b$.\n\n3. When the referee receives $a$ and $b$ from Alice and Bob,\n   the referee evaluates a particular function that is predicated on the\n   questions $x$ and $y$ as well as the answers $a$ and\n   $b$. The outcome of this function is either $0$ or\n   $1$, where an outcome of $0$ indicates a loss for Alice and\n   Bob and an outcome of $1$ indicates a win for Alice and Bob.\n\n\nAlice and Bob's goal in the above game is to get the function in Step-3 to\noutput a $1$, or equivalently, to indicate a winning outcome. This type\nof game is referred to as a *nonlocal game*.\n\n## Classical and Quantum Strategies\n\nNow that we have the framework for a nonlocal game, we can consider the\nplayer's *strategy*; how the players play the game given access to certain\nresources. There are a number of strategies that the players can use, but for\nsimplicity, we will restrict our attention to two types of strategies.\n\n1. *Classical strategies*: The players answer the questions in a deterministic\n   manner.\n\n2. *Quantum strategies*: The players make use of quantum resources in the form\n   of a shared quantum state and respective sets of measurements.\n\n\n### Classical strategies\n\nA *classical strategy* for a nonlocal game is one where the players\ndeterministically produce an output for every possible combination of inputs\nthey may receive in the game. The *classical value* of a nonlocal game is the\nmaximum probability achieved by the players over all classical strategies. For\na nonlocal game, $G$, we use $\\omega(G)$ to represent the classical\nvalue of $G$.\n\nOne question you may have is whether a classical strategy can be improved by\nintroducing randomness. If the players randomly select their answers, is it\npossible for them to do potentially better than if they had just played\ndeterministically? As it happens, probabilistic classical strategies cannot\nperform any better than deterministic classical strategies.\n\nThere is therefore no loss in generality in restricting our analysis of\nclassical strategies to deterministic ones and it is assumed that when we use\nthe term classical strategy that we implicitly mean a classical strategy that\nis played deterministically.\n\n### Quantum strategies\n\nA *quantum strategy* for a nonlocal game is one where the players prepare a\nquantum state prior to the start of the game along with respective sets of\nmeasurements that they apply to their respective portions of the shared state\nduring the game based on the questions they receive to generate their answers.\nThe *quantum value* of a nonlocal game is the maximum probability achieved by\nthe players over all quantum strategies. For a nonlocal game, $G$, we use\n$\\omega^*(G)$ to represent the quantum value of $G$.\n\n![nonlocal game quantum strategy](../../../figures/nonlocal_game_quantum_strategy.svg){.center}\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <em>A two-player nonlocal game invoking a quantum strategy.</em></p>\n\nLet us describe the high-level steps for how Alice and Bob play using a quantum\nstrategy.\n\n1. Alice and Bob prepare a state\n   $\\sigma \\in \\text{D}(\\mathcal{U} \\otimes \\mathcal{V})$ prior to the\n   start of the game. We use $\\textsf{U}$ and $\\textsf{V}$ to\n   denote the respective registers of spaces $\\textsf{U}$ and\n   $\\textsf{V}$.\n\n2. The referee sends question $x \\in \\Sigma_A$ to Alice and\n   $y \\in \\Sigma_B$ to Bob.\n\n3. Alice and Bob perform a *measurement* on their system. The outcome of\n   this measurement yields their answers $a \\in \\Gamma_A$ and\n   $b \\in \\Gamma_B$. Specifically, Alice and Bob have collections of\n   measurements\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\{ A_a^x : a \\in \\Gamma_{\\text{A}} \\} \\subset \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{U})\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\{ B_b^y : b \\in \\Gamma_{\\text{B}} \\} \\subset \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{V}),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n  such that the measurements satisfy\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_A} A_a^x = \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{U}}\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\sum_{b \\in \\Gamma_B} B_b^y = \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{V}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n*4.* The referee determines whether Alice and Bob win or lose, based on the\n   questions $x$ and $y$ as well as the answers $a$ and\n   $b$.\n\n\nFor certain games, the probability that the players obtain a winning outcome is\nhigher if they use a quantum strategy as opposed to a classical one. This\nstriking separation is one primary motivation to study nonlocal games, as it\nprovides examples of tasks that benefit from the manipulation of quantum\ninformation.\n\n## Calculating the classical value\n(Coming soon)\n\n## Calculating the quantum value\n\nThe ability to calculate the quantum value for an arbitrary nonlocal game is a\nhighly non-trivial task. Indeed, the quantum value is only known in special\ncases for certain nonlocal games.\n\nFor an arbitrary nonlocal game, there exist approaches that place upper and\nlower bounds on the quantum value. The lower bound approach is calculated using\nthe technique of semidefinite programming [@liang2007bounds]. While this method is efficient\nto carry out, it does not guarantee convergence to the quantum value (although\nin certain cases, it is attained).\n\nThe primary idea of this approach is to note that fixing the measurements on one\nsystem yields the optimal measurements of the other system via an SDP. The\nalgorithm proceeds in an iterative manner between two SDPs. In the first SDP, we\nassume that Bob's measurements are fixed, and Alice's measurements are to be\noptimized over. In the second SDP, we take Alice's optimized measurements from\nthe first SDP and now optimize over Bob's measurements. This method is repeated\nuntil the quantum value reaches a desired numerical precision.\n\nFor completeness, the first SDP where we fix Bob's measurements and optimize\nover Alice's measurements is given as SDP-1.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\textbf{SDP-1:} \\quad & \\\\\n\\text{maximize:} \\quad & \\sum_{(x,y \\in \\Sigma)} \\pi(x,y)\n\\sum_{(a,b) \\in \\Gamma}\nV(a,b|x,y)\n\\langle B_b^y, A_a^x \\rangle \\\\\n\\text{subject to:} \\quad & \\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_{\\mathsf{A}}} =\n\\tau, \\qquad \\qquad\n\\forall x \\in \\Sigma_{\\mathsf{A}}, \\\\\n\\quad & A_a^x \\in \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{A}),\n\\qquad\n\\forall x \\in \\Sigma_{\\mathsf{A}}, \\\n\\forall a \\in \\Gamma_{\\mathsf{A}}, \\\\\n& \\tau \\in \\text{D}(\\mathcal{A}).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the second SDP where we fix Alice's measurements and optimize over\nBob's measurements is given as SDP-2.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\textbf{SDP-2:} \\quad & \\\\\n\\text{maximize:} \\quad & \\sum_{(x,y \\in \\Sigma)} \\pi(x,y)\n\\sum_{(a,b) \\in \\Gamma} V(a,b|x,y)\n\\langle B_b^y, A_a^x \\rangle \\\\\n\\text{subject to:} \\quad & \\sum_{b \\in \\Gamma_{\\mathsf{B}}} =\n\\mathbb{I}, \\qquad \\qquad\n\\forall y \\in \\Sigma_{\\mathsf{B}}, \\\\\n\\quad & B_b^y \\in \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{B}),\n\\qquad \\forall y \\in \\Sigma_{\\mathsf{B}}, \\\n\\forall b \\in \\Gamma_{\\mathsf{B}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n\n## Lower bounding the quantum value in `toqito`\n\nThe `|toqito\u27e9` software implements both of these optimization problems using\nthe `cvxpy` library. We see-saw between the two SDPs until the value we\nobtain reaches a specific precision threshold.\n\nAs we are not guaranteed to obtain the true quantum value of a given nonlocal\ngame as this approach can get stuck in a local minimum, the `|toqito\u27e9`\nfunction allows the user to specify an `iters` argument that runs the\nsee-saw approach a number of times and then returns the highest of the values\nobtained.\n\n### Example: Lower bounding the quantum value of the CHSH game\n\nLet us consider calculating the lower bound on the quantum value of the CHSH\ngame.\n\n!!! note\n\n    As the CHSH game is a subtype of nonlocal game referred to as an XOR game,\n    we do not necessarily need to resort to this lower bound technique as there\n    exists a specific SDP formulation that one can use to directly compute the\n    quantum value of an XOR game. More information on how one defines the CHSH\n    game as well as this method to directly calculate the quantum value of an\n    XOR game is provided in [Calculating the Quantum and Classical Value of a Two-Player XOR Game](../xor_quantum_value)\n\nWe will use the CHSH game here as an illustrative example as we already know\nwhat the optimal quantum value should be.\n\nThe first step is to use `numpy` to encode a matrix that encapsulates the\nprobabilities with which the questions are asked to Alice and Bob. As defined in\nthe CHSH game, each of the four pairs\n$\\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\\}$ are all equally likely. We encode\nthis in the matrix as follows.\n\n\n"
