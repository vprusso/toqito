Alice picks $\\rho_i$ with probability\n   $p_i$ from her ensemble and sends $\\rho_i$ to Bob.\n\n*2.* Bob receives $\\rho_i$. Both Alice and Bob are aware of how the\n   ensemble is defined but he does *not* know what index $i$\n   corresponding to the state $\\rho_i$ he receives from Alice is.\n\n*3.* Bob wants to guess which of the states from the ensemble he was given. In\n   order to do so, he may measure $\\rho_i$ to guess the index $i$\n   for which the state in the ensemble corresponds.\n\n\nThis setting is depicted in the following figure.\n\n![Quantum state distinguishability](../../../figures/quantum_state_distinguish.svg){.center}\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <em>Figure: Quantum state distinguishability setting.</em></p>\nDepending on the sets of measurements that Alice and Bob are allowed to use,\nthe optimal probability of distinguishing a given set of states is characterized\nby the following image.\n\n![Measurement hierarchy](../../../figures/measurement_inclusions.svg){width=\"30%\" .center}\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <em>Figure: Measurement hierarchy.</em></p>\nThat is,the probability that Alice and Bob are able to distinguish using PPT\nmeasurements is a natural upper bound on the optimal probability of\ndistinguishing via separable measurements.\n\nIn general:\n\n* LOCC: These are difficult objects to handle mathematically; difficult to\n  design protocols for and difficult to provide bounds on their power.\n\n* Separable: Separable measurements have a nicer structure than LOCC.\n  Unfortunately, optimizing over separable measurements in NP-hard.\n\n* PPT: PPT measurements offer a nice structure and there exists efficient\n  techniques that allow one to optimize over the set of PPT measurements via\n  semidefinite programming.\n\n\n### Optimal probability of distinguishing a quantum state\n\nThe optimal probability with which Bob can distinguish the state he is given\nmay be obtained by solving the following semidefinite program (SDP).\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{maximize:} \\quad & \\sum_{i=0}^n p_i \\langle M_i, \\rho_i \\rangle \\\\\n\\text{subject to:} \\quad & \\sum_{i=0}^n M_i = \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{X}},\\\\\n& M_i \\in \\text{Pos}(\\mathcal{X}).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis optimization problem is solved in `|toqito\u27e9` to obtain the optimal\nprobability with which Bob can distinguish state $\\rho_i$.\n\nTo illustrate how we can phrase and solve this problem in `|toqito\u27e9`,\nconsider the following example. Assume Alice has an ensemble of quantum states\n\n$$\n\\eta = \\{ (1/2, \\rho_0), (1/2, \\rho_1) \\}\n$$\n\nsuch that\n\n$$\n\\rho_0 = | 0 \\rangle \\langle 0 | = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\rho_1 = | 1 \\rangle \\langle 1 | = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThese states are completely orthogonal to each other, and it is known that Bob\ncan optimally distinguish the state he is given perfectly, i.e. with probability\n$1$.\n\nUsing `|toqito\u27e9`, we can calculate this probability directly as follows:\n\n\n"

        "Specifying similar state distinguishability problems can be done so using this\ngeneral pattern.\n\n### Optimal probability of distinguishing a state via PPT measurements\n\nWe may consider the quantum state distinguishability scenario under somewhat\ndifferent and more limited set of circumstances. Specifically, we may want to\nask the same question but restrict to enforcing that in order to determine the\nstate that Bob is provided, he is limited to using a certain class of\nmeasurement. There are a wider class of measurements with respect to the ones\nwe considered in the previous example referred to as PPT (positive partial\ntranspose).\n\nThe problem of state distinguishability with respect to PPT measurements can\nalso be framed as an SDP and was initially presented in this manner in\n[@Cosentino_2013_PPT]\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{minimize:} \\quad & \\frac{1}{k} \\text{Tr}(Y) \\\\\n\\text{subject to:} \\quad & Y \\geq \\text{T}_{\\mathcal{A}}(\\rho_j), \\quad j = 1, \\ldots, k, \\\\\n& Y \\in \\text{Herm}(\\mathcal{A} \\otimes \\mathcal{B}).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing `|toqito\u27e9`, we can determine the optimal probability for Bob to\ndistinguish a given state from an ensemble if he is only given access to PPT\nmeasurements.\nConsider the following Bell states\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n| \\psi_0 \\rangle = \\frac{|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}, &\\quad\n| \\psi_1 \\rangle = \\frac{|01\\rangle + |10\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\\\\n| \\psi_2 \\rangle = \\frac{|01\\rangle - |10\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}, &\\quad\n| \\psi_3 \\rangle = \\frac{|00\\rangle - |11\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt was shown in [@Cosentino_2013_PPT] and later extended in [@Cosentino_2014_Small] that for the following set of states\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_1^{(2)} &= |\\psi_0 \\rangle | \\psi_0 \\rangle \\langle \\psi_0 | \\langle \\psi_0 |, \\\\\n\\rho_2^{(2)} &= |\\psi_1 \\rangle | \\psi_3 \\rangle \\langle \\psi_1 | \\langle \\psi_3 |, \\\\\n\\rho_3^{(2)} &= |\\psi_2 \\rangle | \\psi_3 \\rangle \\langle \\psi_2 | \\langle \\psi_3 |, \\\\\n\\rho_4^{(2)} &= |\\psi_3 \\rangle | \\psi_3 \\rangle \\langle \\psi_3 | \\langle \\psi_3 |,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthat the optimal probability of distinguishing via a PPT measurement should yield\n$7/8 \\approx 0.875$.\n\nThis ensemble of states and some of its properties with respect to\ndistinguishability were initially considered in [@Yu_2012_Four]. In `|toqito\u27e9`,\nwe can calculate the probability with which Bob can distinguish these states\nvia PPT measurements in the following manner.\n\n\n"
