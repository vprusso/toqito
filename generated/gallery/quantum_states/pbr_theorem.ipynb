We will\ndescribe the theorem's core argument and then use `|toqito\u27e9` to verify the\ncentral mathematical property that the theorem relies on.\n\nThe PBR theorem [@Pusey_2012_On] addresses a fundamental question: Is the\nquantum state (e.g., the wavefunction $|\\psi\\rangle$) a real, objective\nproperty of a single system (an *ontic* state), or does it merely represent\nour incomplete knowledge or information about some deeper underlying reality\n(an *epistemic* state)?\n"

        "## PBR Argument\n\nThe PBR theorem [@Pusey_2012_On] argues against a broad class of epistemic models.\n\n*1.*  **Epistemic Hypothesis**: An epistemic model assumes there is a\n    \"real\" physical state of the system, often denoted by $\\lambda$.\n    The quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is then just a probability\n    distribution over the possible values of $\\lambda$. A key\n    implication is that the distributions for two different quantum states,\n    say $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_1\\rangle$, could overlap. This\n    means that for some underlying physical states $\\lambda$, the system\n    could have been prepared in *either* $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ or\n    $|\\psi_1\\rangle$.\n\nWe can visualize the overlap of these hypothetical probability distributions.\nTo do this, we will create a simple illustrative plot. We are not assuming\nany specific physical model for $\\lambda$; the plot is purely a visual aid to\nmake the concept of overlapping probability distributions concrete.\n\nFor this illustration, we represent the space of possible ontic states $\\lambda$\non the x-axis. We then choose two simple, overlapping normal (Gaussian)\ndistributions to represent the hypothetical probability densities\n$p(\\lambda | \\psi_0)$ and $p(\\lambda | \\psi_1)$. The specific choice of Gaussian distributions\nis arbitrary; any pair of distinct, overlapping distributions would\ndemonstrate the same essential feature.\n\n"

        "!!! note\n    The shaded region $\\Delta$ represents the set of ontic states\n    $\\lambda$ that are ambiguous\u2014the system could have been prepared as\n    $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ or $|\\psi_1\\rangle$. The PBR theorem shows that the\n    existence of any such overlap (for any pair of distinct states) leads to a\n    contradiction with quantum theory's predictions.\n    Figure adapted from the PBR paper [@Pusey_2012_On].\n\n*2.*  **Thought Experiment**: The PBR paper [@Pusey_2012_On] constructs a thought\n    experiment to show this leads to a contradiction. Consider two\n    non-orthogonal quantum states, for example:\n\n$$\n|0\\rangle \\quad \\text{and } \\quad |+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)\n$$\n\nIf their underlying reality distributions overlap, it's possible to prepare a system where its true state $\\lambda$ is consistent\nwith both preparations. Now, imagine we prepare two such systems\nindependently. There is a non-zero chance that the combined physical\nstate $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ is compatible with *any* of the\nfour possible quantum preparations:\n\n$$\n|0\\rangle \\otimes |0\\rangle, \\quad |0\\rangle \\otimes |+\\rangle, \\text{ }\n|+\\rangle \\otimes |0\\rangle, \\quad |+\\rangle \\otimes |+\\rangle\n$$\n\n*3.*  **Contradiction via Antidistinguishability**: The crux of the\n    theorem is to show that quantum mechanics allows for a special\n    entangled measurement on the two systems. This measurement has a\n    remarkable property: each of its possible outcomes is strictly\n    forbidden (has zero probability) for at least one of the four\n    product states.\n\nThis property is known as **antidistinguishability**. A set of states\n$\\{|\\Psi_i\\rangle\\}$ is antidistinguishable if there exists a\nmeasurement with outcomes $\\{M_i\\}$ such that\n$\\langle \\Psi_i | M_i | \\Psi_i \\rangle = 0$ for all $i$.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction:\n\n*   The epistemic model predicts that sometimes the underlying\n        reality $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ is ambiguous.\n*   In these cases, the measurement (which only depends on\n        $\\lambda$) must produce *some* outcome, say outcome $k$.\n*   But what if the state was *actually* prepared as\n        $|\\Psi_k\\rangle$? Quantum mechanics says outcome $k$\n        is impossible for this state.\n\nThis contradiction implies that the initial assumption\u2014that the\ndistributions for $|0\\rangle$ and $|+\\rangle$ overlap\u2014must\nbe false. The PBR theorem generalizes this to any pair of distinct\nquantum states. The conclusion is that, under the assumption of\npreparation independence, the quantum state must be ontic.\n## Verifying Antidistinguishability with `|toqito\u27e9`\n\nWe can now use `|toqito\u27e9` to verify the key requirement for the PBR\ntheorem that the set of four states constructed from $|0\\rangle$\nand $|+\\rangle$ are indeed antidistinguishable.\n\n"
