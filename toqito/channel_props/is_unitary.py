    r"""Given a quantum channel, determine if it is unitary.

    (Section 2.2.1: Definitions and Basic Notions Concerning Channels from
    :cite:`Watrous_2018_TQI`).

    Let :math:`\mathcal{X}` be a complex Euclidean space an let :math:`U \in U(\mathcal{X})` be a
    unitary operator. Then a unitary channel is defined as:

    .. math::
        \Phi(X) = U X U^*.

    Examples
    ==========
    The identity channel is one example of a unitary channel:

    .. math::
        U =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 0 \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}.

    We can verify this as follows:

    >>> from toqito.channel_props import is_unitary
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> kraus_ops = [[np.identity(2), np.identity(2)]]
    >>> is_unitary(kraus_ops)
    True

    We can also specify the input as a Choi matrix. For instance, consider the Choi matrix
    corresponding to the :math:`2`-dimensional completely depolarizing channel.

    .. math::
        \Omega =
        \frac{1}{2}
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}.

    We may verify that this channel is not a unitary channel.

    >>> from toqito.channels import depolarizing
    >>> from toqito.channel_props import is_unitary
    >>> is_unitary(depolarizing(2))
    False
