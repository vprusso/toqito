    r"""Compute the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product between two matrices :cite:`WikiHilbSchOp`.

    The Hilbert-Schmidt inner product between :code:`a_mat` and :code:`b_mat` is defined as

    .. math::

        HS = (A|B) = Tr[A^\dagger B]

    where :math:`|B\rangle = \text{vec}(B)` and :math:`\langle A|` is the dual vector to :math:`|A \rangle`.

    Note: This function has been adapted from :cite:`Rigetti_2022_Forest`.

    Examples
    ==========

    One may consider taking the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between two Hadamard matrices.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.matrices import hadamard
    >>> from toqito.state_metrics import hilbert_schmidt_inner_product
    >>> h = hadamard(1)
    >>> np.around(hilbert_schmidt_inner_product(h, h), decimals=2)
    np.float64(2.0)
