def bures_distance(rho_1: np.ndarray, rho_2: np.ndarray, decimals: int = 10) -> float:
    r"""Compute the Bures distance of two density matrices :cite:`WikiBures`.

    Calculate the Bures distance between two density matrices :code:`rho_1` and :code:`rho_2` defined by:

    .. math::
        \sqrt{2 (1 - F(\rho_1, \rho_2))},

    where :math:`F(\cdot)` denotes the fidelity between :math:`\rho_1` and :math:`\rho_2`. The return is a value between
    :math:`0` and :math:`\sqrt{2}`,with :math:`0` corresponding to matrices: :code:`rho_1 = rho_2` and :math:`\sqrt{2}`
    corresponding to the case: :code:`rho_1` and :code:`rho_2` with orthogonal support.

    Examples
    ==========

    Consider the following Bell state

    .. math::
        u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00 \rangle + |11 \rangle \right) \in \mathcal{X}.

    The corresponding density matrix of :math:`u` may be calculated by:

    .. math::
        \rho = u u^* = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
                         1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                         0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                         0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                         1 & 0 & 0 & 1
                       \end{pmatrix} \in \text{D}(\mathcal{X}).

    In the event where we calculate the Bures distance between states that are identical, we should obtain the value of
    :math:`0`. This can be observed in :code:`toqito` as follows.

    >>> from toqito.state_metrics import bures_distance
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rho = 1 / 2 * np.array(
    ...     [[1, 0, 0, 1],
    ...      [0, 0, 0, 0],
    ...      [0, 0, 0, 0],
    ...      [1, 0, 0, 1]]
    ... )
    >>> sigma = rho
    >>> bures_distance(rho, sigma)
    np.float64(0.0)
