    Examples
    ==========

    The standard basis ket vectors given as :math:`|0 \rangle` and :math:`|1 \rangle` where

    .. math::
        |0 \rangle = \left[1, 0 \right]^{\text{T}} \quad \text{and} \quad
        |1 \rangle = \left[0, 1 \right]^{\text{T}},

    can be obtained in :code:`|toqitoâŸ©` as follows.

    Example:  Ket basis vector: :math:`|0\rangle`.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from toqito.states import basis
        basis(2, 0)

    Example: Ket basis vector: :math:`|1\rangle`.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from toqito.states import basis
        basis(2, 1)
