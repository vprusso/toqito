"""GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) is used to represent a maximally entangled state.

In the GHZ state, the state of qubits are completely dependent on the state of other qubits. This state is an important
part of quantum computing as it is commonly used in algorithms, protocols, error corrections, cryptography, etc.

def ghz(dim: int, num_qubits: int, coeff: list[int] | None = None) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""Generate a (generalized) GHZ state :cite:`Greenberger_2007_Going`.

    Returns a :code:`num_qubits`-partite GHZ state acting on :code:`dim` local dimensions, described
    in :cite:`Greenberger_2007_Going`. For example, :code:`ghz(2, 3)` returns the standard 3-qubit GHZ state on qubits.
    The output of this function is a dense NumPy array.

    For a system of :code:`num_qubits` qubits (i.e., :code:`dim = 2`), the GHZ state can be written
    as

    .. math::
        |GHZ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \left(|0\rangle^{\otimes n} +
        |1 \rangle^{\otimes n} \right)).

    Examples
    ==========

    When :code:`dim = 2`, and :code:`num_qubits = 3` this produces the standard GHZ state

    .. math::
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |000 \rangle + |111 \rangle \right).

    Using :code:`toqito`, we can see that this yields the proper state.

    >>> from toqito.states import ghz
    >>> ghz(2, 3)
    array([[0.70710678],
           [0.        ],
           [0.        ],
           [0.        ],
           [0.        ],
           [0.        ],
           [0.        ],
           [0.70710678]])

    As this function covers the generalized GHZ state, we can consider higher dimensions. For instance here is the GHZ
    state in :math:`\mathbb{C}^{4^{\otimes 7}}` as

    .. math::
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{30}} \left(|0000000 \rangle + 2|1111111 \rangle +
        3|2222222 \rangle + 4|3333333\rangle \right).

    Using :code:`toqito`, we can see this generates the appropriate generalized GHZ state.

    >>> from toqito.states import ghz
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> ghz(4, 7, np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) / np.sqrt(30))
    array([[0.18257419],
           [0.        ],
           [0.        ],
           ...,
           [0.        ],
           [0.        ],
           [0.73029674]])
