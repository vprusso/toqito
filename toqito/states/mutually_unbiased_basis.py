    Examples
    ========

    For the case of dimension 2, the three mutually unbiased bases are provided by:

    .. math::
        M_0 = \left\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle \right\}, \\
        M_1 = \left\{\frac{|0\rangle + |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}
        M_2 = \left\{\frac{|0\rangle + i|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{|0\rangle - i|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}
