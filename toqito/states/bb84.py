"""BB84 states represent the BB84 basis states, which are based on BB84, a quantum key distribution scheme.

In the BB884 scheme, each qubit is encoded with one of the 4 polarization states: 0, 1, +45° or -45°.

    Examples
    ==========
    The BB84 basis states can be obtained in :code:`|toqito⟩` as follows in the form of a list of
