def brauer(dim: int, p_val: int) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""Produce all Brauer states :cite:`WikiBrauer`.

    Produce a matrix whose columns are all of the (unnormalized) "Brauer" states: states that are the :code:`p_val`-fold
    tensor product of the standard maximally-entangled pure state on :code:`dim` local dimensions. There are many such
    states, since there are many different ways to group the :code:`2 * p_val` parties into :code:`p_val` pairs (with
    each pair corresponding to one maximally-entangled state).

    The exact number of such states is:

    >>> import math
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> p_val = 2
    >>> math.factorial(2 * p_val) / (math.factorial(p_val) * 2**p_val)
    3.0

    which is the number of columns of the returned matrix.

    This function has been adapted from QETLAB.

    Examples

    Generate a matrix whose columns are all Brauer states on 4 qubits.

    >>> from toqito.states import brauer
    >>> brauer(2, 2)
