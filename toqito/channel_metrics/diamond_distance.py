def diamond_distance(choi_1: np.ndarray, choi_2: np.ndarray) -> float:
    r"""Return the diamond norm distance between two quantum channels.

    This function is a wrapper around :func:`toqito.channel_metrics.completely_bounded_trace_norm`,
    in that it returns half of the completely bounded trace norm of the difference of its arguments.

    .. note::
        This calculation becomes very slow for 4 or more qubits.


    Examples
    ========
    Consider the depolarizing and identity channels in a 2-dimensional space. The depolarizing channel parameter is
    set to 0.2:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.channels import depolarizing
    >>> from toqito.channel_metrics import diamond_distance
    >>> choi_depolarizing = depolarizing(dim=2, param_p=0.2)
    >>> choi_identity = np.identity(2**2)
    >>> np.around(diamond_distance(choi_depolarizing, choi_identity), decimals=2)
    np.float64(1.0)

    Similarly, we can compute the diamond norm between the dephasing channel (with parameter 0.3) and the identity
    channel:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.channels import dephasing
    >>> from toqito.channel_metrics import diamond_distance
    >>> choi_dephasing = dephasing(dim=2)
    >>> choi_identity = np.identity(2**2)
    >>> np.around(diamond_distance(choi_dephasing, choi_identity), decimals=2)
    np.float64(1.0)
