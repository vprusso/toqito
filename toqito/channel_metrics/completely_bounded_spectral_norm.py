    r"""Compute the completely bounded spectral norm of a quantum channel.

    As defined in :cite:`Watrous_2009_Semidefinite` and :cite:`QETLAB_link`.

    Examples
    ========
    To computer the completely bounded spectral norm of a depolarizing channel,

    >>> from toqito.channels import depolarizing
    >>> from toqito.channel_metrics import completely_bounded_spectral_norm
    >>>
    >>> # Define the depolarizing channel
    >>> choi_depolarizing = depolarizing(dim=2, param_p=0.2)
    >>> completely_bounded_spectral_norm(choi_depolarizing)
