    r"""Find the completely bounded trace norm of a quantum channel.

    Also known as the diamond norm of a quantum
    channel (Section 3.3.2 of :cite:`Watrous_2018_TQI`). The algorithm in p.11 of :cite:`Watrous_2012_Simpler` with
    implementation in QETLAB :cite:`QETLAB_link` is used.

    Examples
    ========
    To computer the completely bounded spectral norm of a depolarizing channel,

    >>> from toqito.channels import depolarizing
    >>> from toqito.channel_metrics import completely_bounded_trace_norm
    >>>
    >>> # Define the depolarizing channel
    >>> choi_depolarizing = depolarizing(dim=2, param_p=0.2)
    >>> completely_bounded_trace_norm(choi_depolarizing)
    1
