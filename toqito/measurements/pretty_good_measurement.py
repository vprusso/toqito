    r"""Return the set of pretty good measurements from a set of vectors and corresponding probabilities.

    This computes the "pretty good measurement" as initially defined in :cite:`Hughston_1993_Complete`.

    The pretty good measurement (PGM) (also known as the "square root measurement") is the set of POVMs :math:`(G_1,
    \ldots, G_n)` such that

    .. math::
        G_i = P^{-1/2} \left(p_i \rho_i\right) P^{-1/2} \quad \text{where} \quad
        P = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \rho_i.

    Examples
    ========
    Consider the collection of trine states.

    .. math::
        u_0 = |0\rangle, \quad
        u_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle + \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right), \quad \text{and} \quad
        u_2 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle - \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right).

    .. jupyter-execute::

     from toqito.measurements import pretty_good_measurement

     states = trine()
     probs = [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3]
