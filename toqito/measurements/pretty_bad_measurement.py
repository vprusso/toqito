    r"""Return the set of pretty bad measurements from a set of vectors and corresponding probabilities.

    This computes the "pretty bad measurement" (PBM) as defined in
    :footcite:`McIrvin_2024_Pretty`. The PBM is an analogue to the "pretty
    good measurement" and is useful for approximating the optimal measurement
    for state exclusion.

    The PBM is defined in terms of the pretty good measurement (PGM).
    Given the PGM operators :math:`(G_1, \ldots, G_n)`, the corresponding PBM
    is the set of POVMs :math:`(B_1, \ldots, B_n)` where

    .. math::
        B_i = \frac{1}{n - 1} \left(\mathbb{I} - G_i\right).

    Examples
    ========
    Consider the collection of trine states.

    .. math::
        u_0 = |0\rangle, \quad
        u_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle + \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right), \quad \text{and} \quad
        u_2 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle - \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right).

    .. jupyter-execute::

     from toqito.states import trine
     from toqito.measurements import pretty_bad_measurement

     states = trine()
     probs = [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3]
     pbm = pretty_bad_measurement(states, probs)
