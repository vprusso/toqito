    r"""Return the set of pretty bad measurements from a set of vectors and corresponding probabilities.

    This computes the "pretty bad measurement" as defined in :cite:`Hughston_1993_Complete` and is an analogous idea to
    the "pretty good measurement" from :cite:`McIrvin_2024_Pretty`. The "pretty bad measurement" is useful in the
    context of state exclusion where the pretty good measurement is often used for minimum-error quantum state
    discrimination.

    The pretty bad measurement (PBM) is defined in terms of an offset of the pretty good measurement (PGM). Recall that
    the PGM is defined as a set of POVMs :math:`(G_1, \ldots, G_n)` such that

    .. math::
        G_i = P^{-1/2} \left(p_i \rho_i\right) P^{-1/2} \quad \text{where} \quad
        P = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \rho_i.

    By proxy, the corresponding PBM is defined as a set of POVMs :math:`(B_1, \ldots, B_n)` where

    .. math::
        B_i = \frac{1}{n - 1} \left(\mathbb{I} - G_i\right).

    Examples
    ========
    Consider the collection of trine states.

    .. math::
        u_0 = |0\rangle, \quad
        u_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle + \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right), \quad \text{and} \quad
        u_2 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle - \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right).
