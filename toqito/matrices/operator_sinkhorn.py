    r"""Perform operator Sinkhorn iteration (iterative Sinkhorn algorithm) on a quantum system's density matrix.

    This function is adapted from QETLAB. :cite:`QETLAB_link`.

    The function relies on Sinkhorn's theorem :cite:`Sinkhorn_1964_Relationship`, which states that "for any
    positive-definite square matrix :math:`A`, there exist diagonal matrices :math:`D_1` and :math:`D_2` such that
    :math:`D_1 \cdot A \cdot D_2` is doubly stochastic.

    The iterative Sinkhorn algorithm alternately rescales the input density matrix of the quantum system along each
    subsystem so that its marginals become uniform (i.e., partial traces or row/column sums become proportional to
    identity), until convergence.

    Upon convergence we end up with a density matrix :math:`\sigma`, which is locally equivalent to the given
    multipartite density matrix :math:`\rho`, but having maximally mixed subsystems. The algorithm will also
    return the list of filtering operations which can be directly applied on :math:`\rho` to arrive at :math:`\sigma`.
    Such converted forms of density matrices are useful to analyse entangled systems and to study effects of operations
    on each subsystems (as discussed in :cite:`Gurvits_2004_Classical`).

    :code:`operator_sinkhorn` returns the result density matrix :math:`\sigma` along with the operations list
    :code:`local_ops`. :math:`\sigma` has all of its (single-party) reduced density matrices
    proportional to the identity, while satisfying

    .. math::
        \sigma = F \cdot \rho \cdot F^{\dagger}.

    In other words, :code:`local_ops` contains invertible local operations that demonstrate that :math:`\rho` and
    :math:`\sigma` are locally equivalent. This can be checked by first obtaining the :math:`F` matrix using the
    elements of :code:`local_ops`.

    For this example, :math:`F_1` = :code:`local_ops[0]`, and :math:`F_2` = :code:`local_ops[1]`
    and the :math:`F` matrix is then

    .. math::
        F = \left( F_1 \otimes F_2 \right)

    and in general,

    .. math::
        F = \left( F_1 \otimes F_2 \otimes F_3 \otimes \cdots F_n \right).

    The variable :code:`local_ops` here will be the list of 2 local filtering operators.

    Examples
    =======

    To obtain a locally normalized density matrix of a random 2-qubit bipartite state using the Sinkhorn operator,
    consider the following example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        import numpy as np
        from toqito.matrices import operator_sinkhorn
        from toqito.rand import random_density_matrix

        rho = random_density_matrix(4, seed=42)
        print("Random density matrix")
        print(rho)

        sigma, local_ops = operator_sinkhorn(rho=rho, dim=[2, 2])
        print("Locally normalized form of input matrix")
        print(sigma)
        print(("Example local invertible operator responsible for returning a locally normalized "
               "form of the input matrix"))
        print(local_ops[0])
