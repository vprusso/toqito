    r"""Produce generalized Pauli operator :cite:`WikiPauliGen`.

    Generates a :code:`dim`-by-:code:`dim` unitary operator. More specifically,
    it is the operator :math:`X^k_1 Z^k_2`, where :math:`X` and :math:`Z` are
    the "gen_pauli_x" and "gen_pauli_z" operators that naturally generalize the Pauli X and
    Z operators. These matrices span the entire space of
    :code:`dim`-by-:code:`dim` matrices as :code:`k_1` and :code:`k_2` range
    from 0 to :code:`dim-1`, inclusive.

    Note that the generalized Pauli operators are also known by the name of
    "discrete Weyl operators". (Lecture 6: Further Remarks On Measurements And Channels from
    :cite:`Watrous_2011_Lecture_Notes`)

    Examples
    ==========

    The generalized Pauli operator for :code:`k_1 = 1`, :code:`k_2 = 0`, and
    :code:`dim = 2` is given as the standard Pauli-X matrix

    .. math::
        G_{1, 0, 2} = \begin{pmatrix}
                         0 & 1 \\
                         1 & 0
                      \end{pmatrix}.

    This can be obtained in :code:`toqito` as follows.

    >>> from toqito.matrices import gen_pauli
    >>> dim = 2
    >>> k_1 = 1
    >>> k_2 = 0
    >>> gen_pauli(k_1, k_2, dim)
    array([[0.+0.j, 1.+0.j],
           [1.+0.j, 0.+0.j]])

    The generalized Pauli matrix :code:`k_1 = 1`, :code:`k_2 = 1`, and
    :code:`dim = 2` is given as the standard Pauli-Y matrix

    .. math::
        G_{1, 1, 2} = \begin{pmatrix}
                        0 & -1 \\
                        1 & 0
                      \end{pmatrix}.

    This can be obtained in :code:`toqito` as follows.

    >>> from toqito.matrices import gen_pauli
    >>> dim = 2
    >>> k_1 = 1
    >>> k_2 = 1
    >>> gen_pauli(k_1, k_2, dim)
    array([[ 0.+0.0000000e+00j, -1.+1.2246468e-16j],
           [ 1.+0.0000000e+00j,  0.+0.0000000e+00j]])
