def cyclic_permutation_matrix(n: int, k: int = 1) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""Create the cyclic permutation matrix for a given dimension :code:`n` :cite:`WikiCyclicPermutation`.

    This function creates a cyclic permutation matrix of 0's and 1's which is a special type of square matrix
    that represents a cyclic permutation of its rows. The function allows fixed points and successive applications.

    Examples
    ==========
    Generate fixed point.

    >>> from toqito.matrices import cyclic_permutation_matrix
    >>> n = 4
    >>> cyclic_permutation_matrix(n)
    array([[0, 0, 0, 1],
           [1, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 1, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 1, 0]])

    Generate successive application.

    >>> from toqito.matrices import cyclic_permutation_matrix
    >>> n = 4
    >>> k = 3
    >>> cyclic_permutation_matrix(n, k)
    array([[0, 1, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 1],
           [1, 0, 0, 0]])

    :param n: int
        The number of rows and columns in the cyclic permutation matrix.

    :param k: int
        The power to which the elements are raised, representing successive applications.

    :return:
        A NumPy array representing a cyclic permutation matrix of dimension :code:`n x n`.
        Each row of the matrix is shifted one position to the right in a cyclic manner,
        creating a circular permutation pattern. If :code:`k` is specified, the function
        raises the matrix to the power of :code:`k`, representing successive applications
        of the cyclic permutation.
