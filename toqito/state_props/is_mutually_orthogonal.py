    are *mutually orthogonal* if and only if
    :math:`\left|\langle u_a, v_b \rangle\right| = 0` for all :math:`a, b \in \Sigma`.

    For :math:`n \in \mathbb{N}`, a set of bases :math:`\left\{
    \mathcal{B}_0, \ldots, \mathcal{B}_{n-1} \right\}` are mutually orthogonal if and only if
    every basis is orthogonal with every other basis in the set, i.e. :math:`\mathcal{B}_x`
    is orthogonal with :math:`\mathcal{B}_x^{\prime}` for all :math:`x \not= x^{\prime}` with
    :math:`x, x^{\prime} \in \Sigma`.

    Examples
    ==========

    The Bell states constitute a set of mutually orthogonal vectors.

    >>> from toqito.states import bell
    >>> from toqito.state_props import is_mutually_orthogonal
    >>> states = [bell(0), bell(1), bell(2), bell(3)]
    >>> is_mutually_orthogonal(states)
    True

    The following is an example of a list of vectors that are not mutually orthogonal.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.states import bell
    >>> from toqito.state_props import is_mutually_orthogonal
    >>> states = [np.array([1, 0]), np.array([1, 1])]
    >>> is_mutually_orthogonal(states)
    False
