    r"""Compute the l1-norm of coherence of a quantum state :cite:`Rana_2017_Log`.

    The :math:`\ell_1`-norm of coherence of a quantum state :math:`\rho` is
    defined as

    .. math::
        C_{\ell_1}(\rho) = \sum_{i \not= j} \left|\rho_{i,j}\right|,

    where :math:`\rho_{i,j}` is the :math:`(i,j)^{th}`-entry of :math:`\rho`
    in the standard basis.

    The :math:`\ell_1`-norm of coherence is the sum of the absolute values of
    the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries of the density
    matrix :code:`rho` in the standard basis.

    This function was adapted from QETLAB.

    Examples
    ========

    The largest possible value of the :math:`\ell_1`-norm of coherence on
    :math:`d`-dimensional states is :math:`d-1`, and is attained exactly by
    the "maximally coherent states": pure states whose entries all have the
    same absolute value.

    >>> from toqito.state_props import l1_norm_coherence
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>>
    >>> # Maximally coherent state.
    >>> v = np.ones((3,1))/np.sqrt(3)
    >>> '%.1f' % l1_norm_coherence(v)
    '2.0'
