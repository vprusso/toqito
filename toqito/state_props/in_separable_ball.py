def in_separable_ball(mat: np.ndarray) -> bool:
    r"""Check whether an operator is contained in ball of separability :footcite:`Gurvits_2002_Largest`.

    Determines whether :code:`mat` is contained within the ball of separable operators centered
    at the identity matrix (i.e. the maximally-mixed state). The size of this ball was derived in
    :footcite:`Gurvits_2002_Largest`.

    This function can be used as a method for separability testing of states in certain scenarios.

    This function is adapted from QETLAB.

    Examples
    ==========

    The only states acting on :math:`\mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^n` in the
    separable ball that do not have full rank are those with exactly 1 zero
    eigenvalue, and the :math:`mn - 1` non-zero eigenvalues equal to each
    other.

    The following is an example of generating a random density matrix with eigenvalues
    :code:`[1, 1, 1, 0]/3`. This example yields a matrix that is contained within the separable
    ball.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from toqito.rand import random_unitary
        from toqito.state_props import in_separable_ball
        import numpy as np
        U = random_unitary(4)
        lam = np.array([1, 1, 1, 0]) / 3
        rho = U @ np.diag(lam) @ U.conj().T
        in_separable_ball(rho)

    The following is an example of generating a random density matrix with eigenvalues
    :code:`[1.01, 1, 0.99, 0]/3`. This example yields a matrix that is not contained within the
    separable ball.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from toqito.rand import random_unitary
        from toqito.state_props import in_separable_ball
        import numpy as np
        U = random_unitary(4)
        lam = np.array([1.01, 1, 0.99, 0]) / 3
        rho = U @ np.diag(lam) @ U.conj().T
        in_separable_ball(rho)
