def is_distinguishable(states: list[np.ndarray], probs: list[float] = None) -> bool:
    r"""Check whether a collection of vectors are (perfectly) distinguishable or not.

    The ability to determine whether a set of quantum states are distinguishable can be obtained via the state
    distinguishability SDP as defined in `state_distinguishability`

    Examples
    ========

    The set of Bell states are an example of distinguishable states. Recall that the Bell states are defined as:

    .. math::
        u_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(|00\rangle + |11\rangle\right), &\quad
        u_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(|00\rangle - |11\rangle\right), \\
        u_3 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(|01\rangle + |10\rangle\right), &\quad
        u_4 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(|01\rangle - |10\rangle\right).

    It can be checked in :code`toqito` that the Bell states are distinguishable:

    >>> from toqito.states import bell
    >>> from toqito.state_props import is_distinguishable
    >>>
    >>> bell_states = [bell(0), bell(1), bell(2), bell(3)]
    >>> is_distinguishable(bell_states)
    np.True_
