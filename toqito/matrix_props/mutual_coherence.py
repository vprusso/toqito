"""Computes the mutual coherence for a list of 1D numpy arrays."""

def mutual_coherence(vectors: list[np.ndarray]) -> float:
    r"""Calculate the mutual coherence of a collection of input vectors.

    The mutual coherence of a collection of input vectors is defined as the maximum
    absolute value of the inner product between any two distinct vectors, divided by the
    product of their normsÂ :cite:`WikiMutualCoh`. It provides a measure of how
    similar the vectors are to each other.

    Examples
    =======
    .. jupyter-execute::

        import numpy as np
        from toqito.matrix_props.mutual_coherence import mutual_coherence
        example_A = [np.array([1, 0]), np.array([0, 1])]
        print("Result for example_A = ",mutual_coherence(example_A))
        # An example with a larger set of vectors
        example_B = [np.array([1, 0, 1]), np.array([0, 1, 1]), np.array([1, 1, 0])]
        print("Result for example_B = ",mutual_coherence(example_B))
