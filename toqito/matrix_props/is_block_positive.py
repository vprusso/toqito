    Examples
    ==========

    The swap operator is always block positive, since it is the Choi
    matrix of the transpose map.

    >>> from toqito.matrix_props import is_block_positive
    >>> from toqito.perms import swap_operator
    >>>
    >>> mat = swap_operator(3)
    >>> is_block_positive(mat)
    True

    However, it's not 2 - block positive.

    >>> from toqito.matrix_props import is_block_positive
    >>> from toqito.perms import swap_operator
    >>>
    >>> mat = swap_operator(3)
    >>> is_block_positive(mat, k=2)
    False

    :param mat: A bipartite Hermitian operator.
    :param k: A positive integer indicating that the function should determine whether or not
              the input operator is k-block positive, i.e., whether or not it remains nonnegative
              under left and right multiplication by vectors with Schmidt rank <= k (default 1).
    :param dim: The dimension of the two sub-systems. By default it's assumed to be equal.
    :param effort: An integer value indicating the amount of computation you want to devote to
                   determine block positivity before giving up.
    :param rtol: The relative tolerance parameter (default 1e-05).
    :return: Return :code:`True` if matrix is k-block positive definite,
             :code:`False` if not, or raise a runtime error if we are unable to determine
             whether or not the operator is block positive.
