    should be used, where this example uses all products of 1 measurement, all products of
    one Alice and one Bob measurement, and all products of two Alice and one Bob measurement.

    The commuting measurement assemblage operator must be given as a dictionary. The keys are
    tuples of Alice and Bob questions :math:`x, y` and the values are cvxpy Variables which
    are matrices with entries:
