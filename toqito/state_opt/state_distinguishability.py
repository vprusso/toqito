    r"""Compute probability of state distinguishability :cite:`Eldar_2003_SDPApproach`.

    The "quantum state distinguishability" problem involves a collection of :math:`n` quantum states

    .. math::
        \rho = \{ \rho_1, \ldots, \rho_n \},

    as well as a list of corresponding probabilities

    .. math::
        p = \{ p_1, \ldots, p_n \}.

    Alice chooses :math:`i` with probability :math:`p_i` and creates the state :math:`\rho_i`. Bob
    wants to guess which state he was given from the collection of states.

    For :code:`strategy = "min_error"`, this is the default method that yields the minimal
    probability of error for Bob.

    In that case, this function implements the following semidefinite program that provides the
    optimal probability with which Bob can conduct quantum state distinguishability.

    .. math::
        \begin{align*}
            \text{maximize:} \quad & \sum_{i=0}^n p_i \langle M_i, \rho_i \rangle \\
            \text{subject to:} \quad & M_0 + \ldots + M_n = \mathbb{I},\\
                                     & M_0, \ldots, M_n \geq 0.
        \end{align*}

    For :code:`strategy = "unambiguous"`, Bob never provides an incorrect answer, although it is
    possible that his answer is inconclusive.

    In that case, this function implements the following semidefinite program that provides the
    optimal probability with which Bob can conduct unambiguous quantum state distinguishability.

    .. math::
        \begin{align*}
            \text{maximize:} \quad & \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} \\
            \text{subject to:} \quad & \Gamma - Q \geq 0,\\
                                     & \mathbf{q} \geq 0
        \end{align*}

    .. math::
        \begin{align*}
            \text{minimize:} \quad & \text{Tr}(\Gamma Z) \\
            \text{subject to:} \quad & z_i + p_i + \text{Tr}\left(F_iZ\right)=0,\\
                                     & Z, z \geq 0
        \end{align*}

    where :math:`\mathbf{p}` is the vector whose :math:`i`-th coordinate contains the probability
    that the state is prepared in state :math:`\left|\psi_i\right\rangle`, :math:`\Gamma` is
    the Gram matrix of :math:`\left|\psi_1\right\rangle,\cdots,\left|\psi_n\right\rangle` and :math:`F_i` is
    :math:`-|i\rangle\langle i|`.

    .. warning::
        Note that it only makes sense to distinguish unambiguously when the pure states are linearly
        independent. Calling this function on a set of states that doesn't verify this property will
        return 0.

    Examples
    ==========

    Minimal-error state distinguishability for the Bell states (which are perfectly distinguishable).

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.states import bell
    >>> from toqito.state_opt import state_distinguishability
    >>> states = [bell(0), bell(1), bell(2), bell(3)]
    >>> probs = [1 / 4, 1 / 4, 1 / 4, 1 / 4]
    >>> res, _ = state_distinguishability(vectors=states, probs=probs, primal_dual="dual")
    >>> np.around(res, decimals=2)
    np.float64(1.0)

    Note that if we are just interested in obtaining the optimal value, it is computationally less intensive to compute
    the dual problem over the primal problem. However, the primal problem does allow us to extract the explicit
    measurement operators which may be of interest to us.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.states import bell
    >>> from toqito.state_opt import state_distinguishability
    >>> states = [bell(0), bell(1), bell(2), bell(3)]
    >>> probs = [1 / 4, 1 / 4, 1 / 4, 1 / 4]
    >>> res, measurements = state_distinguishability(vectors=states, probs=probs, primal_dual="primal")
    >>> np.around(measurements[0], decimals=5)  # doctest: +SKIP
    array([[ 0.5+0.j,  0. +0.j, -0. -0.j,  0.5-0.j],
           [ 0. -0.j,  0. +0.j, -0. +0.j,  0. -0.j],
           [-0. +0.j, -0. -0.j,  0. +0.j, -0. +0.j],
           [ 0.5+0.j,  0. +0.j, -0. -0.j,  0.5+0.j]])

    Unambiguous state distinguishability for unbiased states.

    >>> from toqito.state_opt import state_distinguishability
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> states = [np.array([[1.], [0.]]), np.array([[1.],[1.]]) / np.sqrt(2)]
    >>> probs = [1 / 2, 1 / 2]
    >>> res, _ = state_distinguishability(vectors=states, probs=probs, primal_dual="primal", strategy="unambiguous")
    >>> np.around(res, decimals=2)
    np.float64(0.29)
