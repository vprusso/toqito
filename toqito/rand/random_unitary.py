    """Generate a random unitary or orthogonal matrix :cite:`Ozols_2009_RandU`.

    Calculates a random unitary matrix (if :code:`is_real = False`) or a random real orthogonal
    matrix (if :code:`is_real = True`), uniformly distributed according to the Haar measure.

    Examples
    ==========

    We may generate a random unitary matrix. Here is an example of how we may be able to generate a
    random :math:`2`-dimensional random unitary matrix with complex entries.

    .. jupyter-execute::

     from toqito.rand import random_unitary

     complex_dm = random_unitary(2)

     complex_dm


    We can verify that this is in fact a valid unitary matrix using the :code:`is_unitary` function
    from :code:`|toqito‚ü©` as follows

    .. jupyter-execute::

     from toqito.matrix_props import is_unitary

     is_unitary(complex_dm)

    We can also generate random unitary matrices that are real-valued as follows.

    .. jupyter-execute::

     from toqito.rand import random_unitary

     real_dm = random_unitary(2, True)

     real_dm


    Again, verifying that this is a valid unitary matrix can be done as follows.

    .. jupyter-execute::

     from toqito.matrix_props import is_unitary

     is_unitary(real_dm)

    We may also generate unitaries such that the dimension argument provided is a :code:`list` as
    opposed to an :code:`int`. Here is an example of a random unitary matrix of dimension :math:`4`.

    .. jupyter-execute::

     from toqito.rand import random_unitary

     mat = random_unitary([4, 4], True)

     mat


    As before, we can verify that this matrix generated is a valid unitary matrix.

    .. jupyter-execute::

     from toqito.matrix_props import is_unitary

     is_unitary(mat)

    It is also possible to pass a seed to this function for reproducibility.

    .. jupyter-execute::

     from toqito.matrix_props import is_unitary

     seeded = random_unitary(2, seed=42)

     seeded

    And once again, we can verify that this matrix generated is a valid unitary matrix.

    .. jupyter-execute::

     from toqito.matrix_props import is_unitary

     is_unitary(seeded)
