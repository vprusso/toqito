    rho: np.ndarray,

    r"""Swap two subsystems within a state or operator.

    Swaps the two subsystems of the vector or matrix :code:`rho`, where the dimensions of the (possibly more than 2)
    subsystems are given by :code:`dim` and the indices of the two subsystems to be swapped are specified in the 1-by-2
    vector :code:`sys`.

    If :code:`rho` is non-square and not a vector, different row and column dimensions can be specified by putting the
    row dimensions in the first row of :code:`dim` and the column dimensions in the second row of :code:`dim`.

    If :code:`row_only` is set to :code:`True`, then only the rows of :code:`rho` are swapped, but not the columns --
    this is equivalent to multiplying :code:`rho` on the left by the corresponding swap operator, but not on the right.

    Examples
    ==========

    Consider the following matrix

    .. math::
        X =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 5 & 9 & 13 \\
            2 & 6 & 10 & 14 \\
            3 & 7 & 11 & 15 \\
            4 & 8 & 12 & 16
        \end{pmatrix}.

    If we apply the :code:`swap` function provided by :code:`|toqito⟩` on :math:`X`, we should obtain the following
    matrix

    .. math::
        \text{Swap}(X) =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 9 & 5 & 13 \\
            3 & 11 & 7 & 15 \\
            2 & 10 & 6 & 14 \\
            4 & 12 & 8 & 16
        \end{pmatrix}.

    This can be observed by the following example in :code:`|toqito⟩`.

    .. jupyter-execute::

     import numpy as np
     from toqito.perms import swap

     test_mat = np.arange(1, 17).reshape(4, 4)

     swap(test_mat)

    It is also possible to use the :code:`sys` and :code:`dim` arguments, it is possible to specify the system and
    dimension on which to apply the swap operator. For instance for :code:`sys = [1 ,2]` and :code:`dim = 2` we have
    that

    .. math::
        \text{Swap}(X)_{2, [1, 2]} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 9 & 5 & 13 \\
            3 & 11 & 7 & 15 \\
            2 & 10 & 6 & 14 \\
            4 & 12 & 8 & 16
        \end{pmatrix}.

    Using :code:`|toqito⟩` we can see this gives the proper result.

    .. jupyter-execute::

     import numpy as np
     from toqito.perms import swap

     test_mat = np.array(
         [[1, 5, 9, 13], [2, 6, 10, 14], [3, 7, 11, 15], [4, 8, 12, 16]]
     )
     swap(test_mat, [1, 2], 2)

    It is also possible to perform the :code:`swap` function on vectors in addition to matrices.

    .. jupyter-execute::

     import numpy as np
     from toqito.perms import swap

     test_vec = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

     swap(test_vec)
