    r"""Construct the Gram matrix from a list of vectors :cite:`WikiGram`.

    The Gram matrix is a matrix of inner products, where the entry G[i, j] is the inner product of vectors[i] and
    vectors[j]. This function computes the Gram matrix for a given list of vectors.

    Examples
    ========
    >>> # Example with real vectors:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.matrix_ops import vectors_to_gram_matrix
    >>> vectors = [np.array([1, 2]), np.array([3, 4])]
    >>> gram_matrix = vectors_to_gram_matrix(vectors)
    >>> gram_matrix
    array([[ 5, 11],
           [11, 25]])


    >>> # Example with complex vectors:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.matrix_ops import vectors_to_gram_matrix
    >>> vectors = [np.array([1+1j, 2+2j]), np.array([3+3j, 4+4j])]
    >>> gram_matrix = vectors_to_gram_matrix(vectors)
    >>> gram_matrix
    array([[10.+0.j, 22.+0.j],
           [22.+0.j, 50.+0.j]])
