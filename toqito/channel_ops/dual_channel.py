    r"""Compute the dual of a map (quantum channel).

    (Section: Representations and Characterizations of Channels of :cite:`Watrous_2018_TQI`).

    The map can be represented as a Choi matrix, with optional specification of input
    and output dimensions. If the input channel maps :math:`M_{r,c}` to :math:`M_{x,y}`
    then :code:`dim` should be the list :code:`[[r,x], [c,y]]`. If it maps :math:`M_m`
    to :math:`M_n`, then :code:`dim` can simply be the vector :code:`[m,n]`. In this
    case the Choi matrix of the dual channel is returned, obtained by swapping input and
    output (see :func:`toqito.perms.swap`), and complex conjugating all elements.

    The map can also be represented as a list of Kraus operators.
    A list of lists, each containing two elements, corresponds to the families
    of operators :math:`\{(A_a, B_a)\}` representing the map

    .. math::
        \Phi(X) = \sum_a A_a X B^*_a.

    The dual map is obtained by taking the Hermitian adjoint of each operator.
    If :code:`phi_op` is given as a one-dimensional list, :math:`\{A_a\}`,
    it is interpreted as the completely positive map

    .. math::
        \Phi(X) = \sum_a A_a X A^*_a.

    Examples
    ========
    When a channel is represented by a 1-D list of of Kraus operators, the CPTP dual channel can be determined
    as shown below.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.channel_ops import dual_channel
    >>> kraus_1 = np.array([[1, 0, 1j, 0]])
    >>> kraus_2 = np.array([[0, 1, 0, 1j]])
    >>> kraus_list = [kraus_1, kraus_2]
    >>> dual_channel(kraus_list)
    [array([[1.-0.j],
           [0.-0.j],
           [0.-1.j],
           [0.-0.j]]), array([[0.-0.j],
           [1.-0.j],
           [0.-0.j],
           [0.-1.j]])]

    If the input channel's dimensions are different from the output dual channel's dimensions,

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.channel_ops import dual_channel
    >>> from toqito.perms import swap_operator
    >>> input_op = swap_operator([2, 3])
    >>> dual_channel(input_op, [[3, 2], [2, 3]])
    array([[1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0.],
           [0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1.]])
