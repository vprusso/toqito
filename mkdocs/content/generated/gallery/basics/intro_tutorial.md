# Introductory Tutorial

This tutorial illustrates the basics of how to use `|toqito⟩`. This will covers how to
instantiate and use the fundamental objects that `|toqito⟩` provides; namely
quantum states, channels, and measurements.

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-40 -->

This is an introduction to the functionality in `|toqito⟩` and is not meant to serve as an
introduction to quantum information. For more information, please consult the book [@Chuang_2011_Quantum] or the freely available lecture notes [@Watrous_2018_TQI].

This tutorial assumes you have `|toqito⟩` installed on your machine. If you
do not, please consult the installation instructions in [Getting Started](/toqito/getting-started/).

## States

A *quantum state* is a density operator

$$
\rho \in \text{D}(\mathcal{X})
$$

where $\mathcal{X}$ is a complex Euclidean space and where
$\text{D}(\cdot)$ represents the set of density matrices, that is, the
set of matrices that are positive semidefinite with trace equal to $1$.

### Quantum States

A complete overview of the scope of quantum states can be found in the
[states module][toqito.states].

The standard basis ket vectors given as $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ where

$$
| 0 \rangle = [1, 0]^{\text{T}} \quad \text{and} \quad | 1 \rangle = [0, 1]^{\text{T}}
$$

can be defined in `|toqito⟩` as such

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-46 -->

```{.python }

One may define one of the four Bell states written as

$$
u_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(| 00 \rangle + | 11 \rangle \right)
$$

using `|toqito⟩` as

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-68 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

e_0, e_1 = standard_basis(2)
u_0 = 1 / np.sqrt(2) * (np.kron(e_0, e_0) + np.kron(e_1, e_1))
u_0


```

       [0.        ],
       [0.70710678]])
```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-82 -->

The corresponding density operator of $u_0$ can be obtained from

$$
\rho_0 = u_0 u_0^* = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} \in \text{D}(\mathcal{X}).
$$

In `|toqito⟩`, that can be obtained as

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-91 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

e_0, e_1 = standard_basis(2)
u_0 = 1 / np.sqrt(2) * (np.kron(e_0, e_0) + np.kron(e_1, e_1))
rho_0 = u_0 @ u_0.conj().T
rho_0

       [0.5, 0. , 0. , 0.5]])
```

Alternatively, we may leverage the `bell` function in `|toqito⟩` to
generate all four Bell states defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        u_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(| 00 \rangle + | 11 \rangle \right), &\quad
        u_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(| 00 \rangle - | 11 \rangle \right), \\
        u_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(| 01 \rangle + | 10 \rangle \right), &\quad
        u_3 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(| 01 \rangle - | 10 \rangle \right),
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

in a more concise manner as

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 107-114 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

from toqito.states import bell

bell(0)

```




Out:
{: .mkd-glr-script-out }

```{.shell .mkd-glr-script-out-disp }

array([[0.70710678],
       [0.        ],
       [0.        ],
       [0.70710678]])
```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-124 -->

The Bell states constitute one such well-known class of quantum states. There
are many other classes of states that are widely used in the field of quantum
For instance, the GHZ state

$$
| GHZ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | 000 \rangle + | 111 \rangle \right)
$$

is a well-known 3-qubit quantum state. We can invoke this using `|toqito⟩` as

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 124-130 -->

```{.python }

from toqito.states import ghz

ghz(2, 3)


```




Out:
{: .mkd-glr-script-out }

```{.shell .mkd-glr-script-out-disp }

array([[0.70710678],
       [0.        ],
       [0.        ],
       [0.        ],
       [0.        ],
       [0.        ],
       [0.        ],
       [0.70710678]])
```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 131-146 -->

While the 3-qubit form of the GHZ state is arguably the most notable, it is
possible to define a generalized GHZ state

$$
| GHZ_n \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \left( | 0 \rangle^{\otimes n} + | 1
\rangle^{\otimes n} \right).
$$

This generalized state may be obtained in `|toqito⟩` as well. For instance,
here is the GHZ state $\mathbb{C}^{4^{\otimes 7}}$ as

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{30}} \left(| 0000000 \rangle + 2| 1111111 \rangle + 3|
2222222 \rangle + 4| 3333333\rangle \right).
$$

###Properties of Quantum States

Given a quantum state, it is often useful to be able to determine certain
*properties* of the state.

For instance, we can check if a quantum state is pure, that is, if the density
matrix that describes the state has rank 1.

Any one of the Bell states serve as an example of a pure state

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 169-177 -->

```{.python }

from toqito.state_props import is_pure
from toqito.states import bell

rho = bell(0) @ bell(0).conj().T
is_pure(rho)


```




Out:
{: .mkd-glr-script-out }

```{.shell .mkd-glr-script-out-disp }

True
```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 178-190 -->

Another property that is useful is whether a given state is PPT (positive
partial transpose), that is, whether the state remains positive after taking
the partial transpose of the state.

For quantum states consisting of shared systems of either dimension $2
\otimes 2$ or $2 \otimes 3$, the notion of whether a state is PPT serves
as a method to determine whether a given quantum state is entangled or
separable.

As an example, any one of the Bell states constitute a canonical maximally
entangled state over $2 \otimes 2$ and therefore should not satisfy the
PPT criterion.

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 190-198 -->

```{.python }

from toqito.state_props import is_ppt
from toqito.states import bell

rho = bell(2) @ bell(2).conj().T
is_ppt(rho)


```




Out:
{: .mkd-glr-script-out }

```{.shell .mkd-glr-script-out-disp }

False
```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 199-209 -->

As we can see, the PPT criterion is `False` for an entangled state in
$2 \otimes 2$.

Determining whether a quantum state is separable or entangled is often useful
but is, unfortunately, NP-hard. For a given density matrix represented by a
quantum state, we can use `|toqito⟩` to run a number of separability tests
from the literature to determine if it is separable or entangled.

For instance, the following bound-entangled tile state is found to be entangled
(i.e. not separable).

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 209-223 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

from toqito.state_props import is_separable
from toqito.states import tile

rho = np.identity(9)
for i in range(5):
    rho -= tile(i) @ tile(i).conj().T

rho /= 4
is_separable(rho)


```




Out:
{: .mkd-glr-script-out }

```{.shell .mkd-glr-script-out-disp }

False
```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 224-249 -->

Further properties that one can check via `|toqito⟩` may be found in the
[state properties module][toqito.state_props].

###Distance Metrics for Quantum States

Given two quantum states, it is often useful to have some way in which to
quantify how similar or different one state is from another.

One well known metric is the *fidelity* function defined for two quantum
states. For two states $\rho$ and $\sigma$, one defines the
fidelity between $\rho$ and $\sigma$ as

$$
|| \sqrt{\rho} \sqrt{\sigma} ||_1,
$$

where $|| \cdot ||_1$ denotes the trace norm.

The fidelity function yields a value between $0$ and $1$, with
$0$ representing the scenario where $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are
as different as can be and where a value of $1$ indicates a scenario
where $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are identical.

Let us consider an example in `|toqito⟩` where we wish to calculate the
fidelity function between quantum states that happen to be identical.

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 249-262 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

from toqito.state_metrics import fidelity
from toqito.states import bell

# Define two identical density operators.
rho = bell(0) @ bell(0).conj().T
sigma = bell(0) @ bell(0).conj().T

# Calculate the fidelity between `rho` and `sigma`
np.around(fidelity(rho, sigma), decimals=2)

```




Out:
{: .mkd-glr-script-out }

```{.shell .mkd-glr-script-out-disp }

np.float64(1.0)
```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 263-319 -->

There are a number of other metrics one can compute on two density matrices
including the trace norm, trace distance. These and others are also available
in `|toqito⟩`. For a full list of distance metrics one can compute on
quantum states, consult the docs.

##Channels

A *quantum channel* can be defined as a completely positive and trace
preserving linear map.

More formally, let $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ represent
complex Euclidean spaces and let $\text{L}(\cdot)$ represent the set of
linear operators. Then a quantum channel, $\Phi$ is defined as

$$
\Phi: \text{L}(\mathcal{X}) \rightarrow \text{L}(\mathcal{Y})
$$

such that $\Phi$ is completely positive and trace preserving.

###Quantum Channels

The partial trace operation is an often used in various applications of quantum
information. The partial trace is defined as

$$
\left( \text{Tr} \otimes \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{Y}} \right)
\left(X \otimes Y \right) = \text{Tr}(X)Y
$$

where $X \in \text{L}(\mathcal{X})$ and $Y \in
\text{L}(\mathcal{Y})$ are linear operators over complex Euclidean spaces
$\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$.

Consider the following matrix

$$
X = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
        5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
        9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
        13 & 14 & 15 & 16
    \end{pmatrix}.
$$

Taking the partial trace over the second subsystem of $X$ yields the following matrix

$$
\text{Tr}_B(X) = \begin{pmatrix}
            7 & 11 \\
            23 & 27
            \end{pmatrix}.
$$

By default, the partial trace function in `|toqito⟩` takes the trace of the second
subsystem.

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 319-328 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

from toqito.matrix_ops import partial_trace

test_input_mat = np.arange(1, 17).reshape(4, 4)
partial_trace(test_input_mat)


```




Out:
{: .mkd-glr-script-out }

```{.shell .mkd-glr-script-out-disp }

array([[ 7, 11],
       [23, 27]])
```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 329-340 -->

By specifying the `sys = [0]` argument, we can perform the partial trace over the first
subsystem (instead of the default second subsystem as done above). Performing the partial
trace over the first subsystem yields the following matrix

$$
X_{pt, 1} = \begin{pmatrix}
                12 & 14 \\
                20 & 22
            \end{pmatrix}.
$$


<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 340-348 -->

```{.python }
import numpy as np

from toqito.matrix_ops import partial_trace

test_input_mat = np.arange(1, 17).reshape(4, 4)
partial_trace(test_input_mat, sys=[0])


```




Out:
{: .mkd-glr-script-out }

```{.shell .mkd-glr-script-out-disp }

array([[12, 14],
       [20, 22]])
```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 349-392 -->

Another often useful channel is the *partial transpose*. The *partial transpose*
is defined as

$$
\left( \text{T} \otimes \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{Y}} \right)
\left(X\right)
$$

where $X \in \text{L}(\mathcal{X})$ is a linear operator over the complex
Euclidean space $\mathcal{X}$ and where $\text{T}$ is the transpose
mapping $\text{T} \in \text{T}(\mathcal{X})$ defined as

$$
\text{T}(X) = X^{\text{T}}
$$

for all $X \in \text{L}(\mathcal{X})$.

Consider the following matrix

$$
X = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
        5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
        9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
        13 & 14 & 15 & 16
    \end{pmatrix}.
$$

Performing the partial transpose on the matrix $X$ over the second
subsystem yields the following matrix

$$
X^{T_B} = \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 5 & 3 & 7 \\
            2 & 6 & 4 & 8 \\
            9 & 13 & 11 & 15 \\
            10 & 14 & 12 & 16
            \end{pmatrix}.
$$

By default, in `|toqito⟩`, the partial transpose function performs the transposition on
the second subsystem as follows.

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 392-401 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

from toqito.matrix_ops import partial_transpose

       [10, 14, 12, 16]])
```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 402-414 -->

By specifying the `sys = [0]` argument, we can perform the partial transpose over the
first subsystem (instead of the default second subsystem as done above). Performing the partial 
transpose over the first subsystem yields the following matrix

$$
X_{pt, 1} = \begin{pmatrix}
                1 & 2 & 9 & 10 \\
                5 & 6 & 13 & 14 \\

       [ 7,  8, 15, 16]])
```

**Applying Quantum Channels**

Another important operation when working with quantum channels is applying them to quantum states. [`apply_channel`](toqito.channel_ops.apply_channel.apply_channel) in `|toqito⟩` provides a convenient way to apply a quantum channel (represented by its Choi matrix) to a given quantum state.

Here, we illustrate how to apply two widely used channels – the depolarizing channel and the dephasing channel – using [`apply_channel`](toqito.channel_ops.apply_channel.apply_channel).

**Depolarizing Channel**

The depolarizing channel replaces a state with the maximally mixed state with probability $p$ and leaves it unchanged with probability $(1-p)$. Mathematically, it is defined as

$$
\mathcal{N}(\rho) = (1-p) \rho + p\,\frac{\mathbb{I}}{d},
$$

where $\mathbb{I}$ is the identity operator and $d$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space. The example below applies the depolarizing channel with $p=0.3$ to the computational basis state $|0\rangle$.

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 438-454 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

from toqito.channel_ops import apply_channel
from toqito.channels import depolarizing

# Create a quantum state |0⟩⟨0|.
rho = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 0]])

# Generate the depolarizing channel Choi matrix with noise probability p = 0.3.
choi = depolarizing(2, 0.3)

# Apply the depolarizing channel using apply_channel.
output_state = apply_channel(rho, choi)
print(output_state)

```




Out:
{: .mkd-glr-script-out }

```{.shell .mkd-glr-script-out-disp }
[[0.65 0.  ]
 [0.   0.35]]

```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 455-464 -->

**Dephasing Channel**

The dephasing channel reduces the off-diagonal elements of a density matrix without changing the diagonal entries, thereby diminishing quantum coherence. It is commonly expressed as

$$
\mathcal{N}(\rho) = (1-p) \rho + p\, Z \rho Z,
$$

where $Z$ is the Pauli-Z operator and $p$ represents the dephasing probability. The example below demonstrates how to apply the dephasing channel with $p=0.4$ to the plus state $|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$.

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 464-481 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

from toqito.channel_ops import apply_channel
from toqito.channels import dephasing

# Create a quantum state |+⟩⟨+|.
rho = np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5]])

# Generate the dephasing channel Choi matrix with dephasing probability p = 0.4.
choi = dephasing(2, 0.4)

# Apply the dephasing channel using apply_channel.
output_state = apply_channel(rho, choi)
print(output_state)


```

 [0.2 0.5]]

```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 482-496 -->

###Noisy Channels

Quantum noise channels model the interaction between quantum systems and their environment, resulting in decoherence and loss of quantum information. The `|toqito⟩` library provides implementations of common noise models used in quantum information processing.

**Phase Damping Channel**

The phase damping channel models quantum decoherence where phase information is lost without any energy dissipation. It is characterized by a parameter $\gamma$ representing the probability of phase decoherence.

$$
K_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \sqrt{1 - \gamma} \end{pmatrix}, \quad
K_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \sqrt{\gamma} \end{pmatrix}
$$

The phase damping channel can be applied to a quantum state as follows:

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 496-508 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

from toqito.channels import phase_damping

# Create a density matrix with coherence.
rho = np.array([[1, 0.5], [0.5, 1]])

# Apply phase damping with γ = 0.2.
result = phase_damping(rho, gamma=0.2)
print(result)

```




Out:
{: .mkd-glr-script-out }

```{.shell .mkd-glr-script-out-disp }
[[1.       +0.j 0.4472136+0.j]
 [0.4472136+0.j 1.       +0.j]]

```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 509-521 -->

Note that the off-diagonal elements (coherences) are reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{1-\gamma}$, while the diagonal elements (populations) remain unchanged.

**Amplitude Damping Channel**

The amplitude damping channel models energy dissipation from a quantum system to its environment, such as the spontaneous emission of a photon. It is parameterized by $\gamma$, representing the probability of losing a quantum of energy.

$$
K_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \sqrt{1 - \gamma} \end{pmatrix}, \quad
K_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \sqrt{\gamma} \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Here's how to use the amplitude damping channel:

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 521-533 -->

```{.python }

import numpy as np

from toqito.channels import amplitude_damping

# Create a quantum state.
rho = np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5]])

# Apply amplitude damping with γ = 0.3.
result = amplitude_damping(rho, gamma=0.3)
print(result)

```

```





<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 534-542 -->

**Bit-Flip Channel**

The bit-flip channel randomly flips the state of a qubit with probability $p$, analogous to the classical bit-flip error in classical information theory.

$$
K_0 = \sqrt{1 - p} \, I = \sqrt{1 - p} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
K_1 = \sqrt{p} \, X = \sqrt{p} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}

Observe that the result is a mixed state with 75% probability of being in state $|0\rangle$ and 25% probability of being in state $|1\rangle$, as expected for a bit flip error with probability $p = 0.25$.

**Pauli Channel**

The Pauli channel is a quantum noise model that applies a probabilistic mixture of Pauli operators
to a quantum state. It is defined by a probability vector $(p_0, \ldots, p_{4^q - 1})$, where
$q$ is the number of qubits, and $P_i$ are the Pauli operators acting on the system.

$$
\Phi(\rho) = \sum_{i=0}^{4^q - 1} p_i P_i \rho P_i^\dagger
$$

For example, when $q = 1$, the Pauli operators are:
$P_0 = I$, $P_1 = X$, $P_2 = Y$, and $P_3 = Z$. For multiple qubits,
these operators are extended as tensor products.

It is also worth noting that when

* $P_2 = 0$, and $P_3 = 0$, [`pauli_channel`][toqito.channels.pauli_channel] is equivalent to a [`bitflip`][toqito.channels.bitflip] channel

* $P_1 = 0$, and $P_2 = 0$, [`pauli_channel`][toqito.channels.pauli_channel] is equivalent to a Phase Flip channel

* $P_1 = 0$, and $P_3 = 0$, [`pauli_channel`][toqito.channels.pauli_channel] is equivalent to a Bit and Phase Flip channel

The Pauli channel can be used to apply noise to an input quantum state or generate a Choi matrix.

Here, the probabilities correspond to applying the identity ($I$), bit-flip ($X$),
phase-flip ($Z$), and combined bit-phase flip ($Y$) operators.

##Measurements

A *measurement* can be defined as a function

$$
\mu: \Sigma \rightarrow \text{Pos}(\mathcal{X})
$$

satisfying

$$
\sum_{a \in \Sigma} \mu(a) = \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{X}}
$$

where $\Sigma$ represents a set of measurement outcomes and where
$\mu(a)$ represents the measurement operator associated with outcome
$a \in \Sigma$.

###POVM

POVM (Positive Operator-Valued Measure) is a set of positive operators that sum up to the identity.

Consider the following matrices:

$$
M_0 =
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\quad \text{and} \quad
M_1 =
\begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Our function expects this set of operators to be a POVM because it checks if the operators
sum up to the identity, ensuring that the measurement outcomes are properly normalized.

###Random POVM

We may also use [`random_povm`][toqito.rand.random_povm] to randomly generate a POVM, and can verify that a
randomly generated set satisfies the criteria for being a POVM set.

###Measurement Operators

Consider the following state:

$$
u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} e_0 + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} e_1
$$

where we define $u u^* = \rho \in \text{D}(\mathcal{X})$ and $e_0$
and $e_1$ are the standard basis vectors.

$$
e_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad e_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

The measurement operators are defined as shown below:

$$
P_0 = e_0 e_0^* \quad \text{and} \quad P_1 = e_1 e_1^*.
$$

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 712-726 -->

```{.python }

e_0, e_1 = standard_basis(2)

u = (1 / np.sqrt(3)) * e_0 + (np.sqrt(2 / 3)) * e_1
rho = u @ u.conj().T

proj_0 = e_0 @ e_0.conj().T
proj_1 = e_1 @ e_1.conj().T

```

Then the probability of obtaining outcome $0$ is given by

$$
\langle P_0, \rho \rangle = \frac{1}{3}.
$$

###Pretty Good Measurement

Consider "pretty good measurement" on the set of trine states.

The pretty good measurement (PGM), also known as the "square root measurement" is a set of POVMs $(G_1, \ldots, G_n)$ defined as

$$
G_i = P^{-1/2} \left(p_i \rho_i\right) P^{-1/2} \quad \text{where} \quad P = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \rho_i.
$$

This measurement was initially defined in [@Hughston_1993_Complete] and has found applications in quantum state discrimination tasks.
While not always optimal, the PGM provides a reasonable measurement strategy that can be computed efficiently.

For example, consider the following trine states:

$$
u_0 = |0\rangle, \quad
u_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle + \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right), \quad \text{and} \quad
u_2 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle - \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right).
$$

<!-- GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 765-774 -->

```{.python }

from toqito.measurements import pretty_good_measurement
from toqito.states import trine

states = trine()
probs = [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3]
pgm = pretty_good_measurement(states, probs)
pgm

       [-0.28867513,  0.5       ]])]
```

###Pretty Bad Measurement

Similarly, we can consider so-called "pretty bad measurement" (PBM) on the set of trine states [@McIrvin_2024_Pretty].

The pretty bad measurement (PBM) is a set of POVMs $(B_1, \ldots, B_n)$ defined as

$$
B_i = \left(P + (n-1)p_i \rho_i\right)^{-1} p_i \rho_i \left(P + (n-1)p_i \rho_i\right)^{-1} \quad \text{where} \quad P = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \rho_i.
$$

Like the PGM, the PBM provides a measurement strategy for quantum state discrimination, but with different properties that can be useful in certain contexts.

$$
u_0 = |0\rangle, \quad
u_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle + \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right), \quad \text{and} \quad
u_2 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle - \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right).
$$
